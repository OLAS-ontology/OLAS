OLAS: Ontology of Laboratory Animal Science 

The OLAS is established as a community-based biomedical ontology in the field of laboratory animal science, with the aim to ontologically represent entities and the relations among the entities related to laboratory animal science. 

You can use our [Wiki site](https://github.com/OLAS-ontology/OLAS/wiki) to post your issues. 

OLAS is now deposited at:
http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/OLAM (note: will be changed later to OLAS)

We appreciate any feedback and collaboration from the community. Thanks!
