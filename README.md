OLAM: Ontology of Laboratory Animal Medicine

The OLAM is established as a community-based biomedical ontology in the field of laboratory animal medicine, with the aim to ontologically represent entities and the relations among the entities related to laboratory animal medicine. 

OLAM is initiated by veterinarians and researchers in the [Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine (ULAM)](https://animalcare.umich.edu/unit-laboratory-animal-medicine) of the University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.
