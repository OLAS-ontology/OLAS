OLAS: Ontology of Laboratory Animal Science 

The OLAS is established as a community-based biomedical ontology in the field of laboratory animal science, with the aim to ontologically represent entities and the relations among the entities related to laboratory animal science. 

Note that OLAS was previously named OLAM for the Ontology of Laboratory Animal Medicine, which was first initiated by Oliver He in early 2019 at the University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. It's renamed to OLAS on August 29, 2024, to reflect more accurately the focuses of the ontology. 

You can post your issues to our OLAS issue tracker: 
[https://github.com/OLAS-ontology/OLAS/issues](https://github.com/OLAS-ontology/OLAS/issues)

OLAS is now deposited at:
http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/OLAM (note: will be changed later to OLAS)

We appreciate any feedback and collaboration from the community. Thanks!
