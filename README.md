OLAM: Ontology of Laboratory Animal Medicine

The OLAM is established as a community-based biomedical ontology in the field of laboratory animal medicine, with the aim to ontologically represent entities and the relations among the entities related to laboratory animal medicine. 

OLAM is initiated in the Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine (ULAM; https://animalcare.umich.edu/unit-laboratory-animal-medicine) of the University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. 

Please contact Oliver He for OLAM related information. We appreciate any feedback and collaboration from the community.
